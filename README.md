# Development and contribution
Have you ever been bored by propagating all the parameters for a new type of a machine used in your models?
Here's the solution:
* Build your own database of different machine parameters by extending from Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Utilities.ParamterRecords
* Use the machine models from this library: they're extending from the machine models of the Modelica Standard Library
* Propagate all necessary parameters with just one parameter record!
* Change operational parameters in the machine model, if desired.
